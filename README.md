# Glyph Miner

Glyph Miner is a web based miner used to mine tokens that follow the Glyphs Protocol.

Requires a browser that supports WebGPU.

A temporary wallet will be created that must be funded to pay transaction fees. Minted tokens can be sent to any address.

## Roadmap

- Replace temporary wallet with browser extension
